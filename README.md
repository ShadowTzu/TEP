# TEP
Timed Execution Procedure

These classes allows you to run a list of functions for a given time.
There are three types of behavior:
- Run a function until the time that was given to him has elapsed then moves to the next function.
- Execute multiple functions simultaneously until their time is up.
- Run a function with the time argument until it returns True then move to the next function.
